# Snapchat-vs-Instagram
Designed a Python script to pull 10K tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API with the keywords Instagram and Snapchat. 
Using this data I created a common tweet word cloud and found the most influential tweets, which was an average of the 
retweet count, reply count, and quote count per tweet. I also found the polarity and subjectivity scores of each keyword.
